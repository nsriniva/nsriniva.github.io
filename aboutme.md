My name is Srini Nariangadu and i'm studying Data Science at Lambda School.

### My story

I have been building, fixing bugs in and improving software for a long time now - most of that time/effort has been in the Networking space.

I am now a student in the DSPT(Data Science Part Time)9 cohort at Lambda School.
